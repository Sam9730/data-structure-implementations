# DATA STRUCTURES IMPLEMENTATION

Project deals with the implementation of different types of DATA STURUCTURES.

Data structures play a very important role in programming. They provide the mechanism of storing the data in different ways. This optimizes searching and memory usage. Data structures play a central role in modern computer science. They enable an efficient storage of data for an easy access.They help in data protection and management.

The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure
The study includes a comparative implementations (i.e. Insertion,Deletion,Searching,Traversal etc.).
The programming language used to implement these sorting algorithms is C++.
